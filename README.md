# Inverted Pendulum 

This is a python code for making and implementing an inverted pendulum using the 'pybox2d' library as the physics engine and 'pygame' library for visualizing the inverted pendulum. 
PID and Fuzzy Logic controllers are used for maintaining the pendulum upright.

## Installation and setup

Follow these steps to install and run the code

### Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure the following are installed

1.) [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

2.) [Pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/)

### 1.) Installing the libraries

Install pybox2d and pygame libarary on your system using pip


### 2.) Run The Simulation

Once dependencies are installed, you can run the project by using the following commands

(For Fuzzy Controller)
```bash
python Inverted_Pendulum_Fuzzy.py
```
(For PID Controller)
```bash
python Inverted_Pendulum_PID.py
```
